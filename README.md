# Unnamed Bullet Hell
# -=================-
- 2D top down, bullet hell obviously.
- Large variety of enemies which have easily telegraphed attacks.
- HUGE bosses which have complicated shot patterns and many phases.
- Once all enemies in a room are destroyed the exit spawns.
- Theme ideas: ancient jungle temple, feudal japan, pharos in space, the possibilities are endless.
- Or let's try occult theme so like wizards, demon goats, etc.
- I have no clue about the theme just do whatever lol.
- Animations: Line 1 walk/idle anim (varies based on enemy),
	line 2 attack wind up anim,
	line 4 attack wind down anim,
	line 4 death anim.
- Enemies have varying phases, damage, bullet patterns,
	aim patterns(where you are vs where you're going to be),
	refire speed, animation speed, etc, some might not even shoot.
- Try to reduce randomness as much as possible, at least in gameplay.
- Make a worm king boss that has a crown on its head and the sprite is HUGE.
